# RJC Weather App

## Your Task
I was tasked with utilizing the the 5 Day Weather Forecast to retrieve weather data for cities.

Aside from formatting and local storage issues, I had an issue with my API key. Working on my machine, the code worked perfectly, but once deployed, the API ceases to work. That issue was resolved changing "http" to "https." I also had an issue with git and somewhere got lost on my commits. After trying to resolve this issue. I created a new repository for the project, void of git errors. Previous work can be found in  https://github.com/rjclemmer/challenge6.

## Notes from Previous Grader

Please make sure to add quality comments to your Javascript source code. Comments enhance the reader's understanding of one's code rather than simply stating the obvious, and they communicate the developer's thought process very effectively. 

I was able to repeat a search for a city's current and future weather conditions by clicking on it in the search history. Good job! However after every search for the city, a "blank" record appears in the city list before the city name. Please make sure to add error handling to your code if the user searches for an invalid city or does not enter any city name and clicks on the "Search" button. Please make sure that your user interface is clean and intuitive.

After specifying a city name and clicking on the search button, the city name, date, current temperature, current humidity, and windspeed were shown, however an icon representation of weather conditions was not shown. In addition, you have managed to display only the forecast for four days, rather than the five-day forecast

Upon startup the application is populated with values of a dummy city along with random values for city, city name, date, current temperature, current humidity, and windspeed. This is not the expected behavior.
