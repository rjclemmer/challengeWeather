#06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

##Your Task
I was tasked with utilizing the the 5 Day Weather Forecast to retrieve weather data for cities.

Aside from formatting and local storage issues, I had an issue with my API key. Working on my machine, the code worked perfectly, but once deployed, the API ceases to work. That issue was resolved changing "http" to "https." I also had an issue with git and somewhere got lost on my commits. After trying to resolve this issue. I created a new repository for the project, void of git errors. Previous work can be found in  https://github.com/rjclemmer/challenge6.
