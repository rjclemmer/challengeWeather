06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard
Your Task
I was tasked with utilizing the the 5 Day Weather Forecast to retrieve weather data for cities.

Aside from formatting and local storage issues, I have run into an issue with my API key. Working on my machine, the code deploys perfectly, but once deployed, the API ceases to work.
